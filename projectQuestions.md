# Questions for the Professor

1. Are we supposed to just solve the problem or use as many tools as possible to "demonstrate our knowledge"? More importantly, what will be the grading criteria?

## Answers from Professors

1. **Answer:**  
   You have to give a solution to the problem, a good technical solution for the problem, "the best one you can think of." Maybe we have to try several options, but not just because, we need to have a reason. We don’t want you to do a system that given an input just computes and returns an output. We want a valid final solution to the client. Try to get a more realistic output, like multiple options, or let the final user see the reasons for the decisions in a visual way. Non-technical aspects are more important in some sense. The technical part is not the main thing.

## Recommendations
- Data analysis to discover underlying information about the decisions. For example: a specific translator may be prioritized for a certain company.

# Questions/Requests for the Company

1. Can we have access to word count per task?  
2. Words per hour for every translator:  
   - Could be deduced if we get the word count.  
3. If the translator specialty doesn’t match the request but the other criteria does, what takes precedent?  
4. Is final quality given by the client or how is it done? If not, can the clients give feedback in some way, if so what is it?  
5. In Task type: "Translation" it’s stated that if the "ProofReading" is done by a superior the quality can be slightly lower:  
   - Can you define "superior" and "slightly lower"?  
   - Do ALL "Translation" type tasks have "ProofReading" or "SpotCheck" tasks assigned after them?  
6. Are "SpotCheck" and "ProofReading" tasks ONLY assigned in tandem with "Translation" or "PostEditing" tasks? Or can they be assigned by themselves?  
7. Can "ProofReading" tasks apply to multiple translation tasks? If so, how do we know which?  
8. The translator specialties are implicit, not explicit, right? As in: a translator specializes in something by having worked a lot on that.  
9. How important is the rule of "The translator’s quality can be slightly lower if the ProofReading is done by a superior" for "Translation" tasks?

1, 2, 3. **Answers:**  
   Put the questions in the presentation so we can ask them directly.

### Questions for Us

1. How do we plan on taking into account specialties for SAT?  
   - **Idea:** It’s a bit dirty but we could create a column for every Group/Industry/Subindustry on the translators’ page that just keeps track of how many times each translator has "worked" for each industry.  
   - **Problem:** We/They would also need to create an update loop every time a task is assigned.
