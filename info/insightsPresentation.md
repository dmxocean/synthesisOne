# Our Presentation

**Model Type:** SAT + ML + (Maybe DL)

## Answers
1. The time zone is equal GTM Time zone for everyone  
2. The input can be tabular data, because they use their own database that we can't work with.  
3. We can ignore the parameter the wildcard indicating, meaning that if the wildcard has Quality then we can ignore it completely(once we have tried taking it into account)  
4. The output need to be interactable recommendation, because human intervention is necessary  
5. Use Data analysis for Expert insight.  
6. We need to infer things from the data to solve the niche situations in "Task_Type" (ProofReading)

# 2nd Group Presentation

**Model Type:** ML

## Notes
- They mainly use ML and output to a Website  
- Very Good Mock-up Visuals (they also use the clients imagery)  
- End to End product, they aim to directly treat with our client's clients  

## Answers
1. Our client's clients aren't as interested in this solution but it can be used for the employees anyway as they would like the same features  
2. **Translators don't have explicit specialities, they are just the person who's worked a lot with the same industry**

# 3rd Group Presentation

**Model Type:** Random Forests

**Note:** Locally hosted "real" website instead of a Mock-Up. Very good looking aswell.

## Answers
- **Q:** "Can we retrieve somehow the updated information of the schedules?"  
  - **A:** We don't have this information  
    For a paternity leave for example, they put that the translator is working on the task "paternity leave" or something like that.  
    We don't even have the times when the translators starts or finishes, it was made for this project(statistical data).  
- **Q:**  
  - **A:** The system should be updated, I'm not gonna say every hour but... (Updated as in what we suggested for ML right?)

# 4th Group Presentation

**Model Type:** SAT + (maybe DL?)

**Note:** Good mock-up UI. Decent actual self-hosted web UI  
Interesting solution, they are predicting: the quality, the expected time spent, for each translator  
Alternative recomendation for non-industry translators. (He hasn't worked much in this kind of thing but he's good in other/ he's cheap/ whatever).

## Answers
- **Q:** We want to know how oyu manage schedules, we have seen the daily hours that one translator works is 10 hours  
  - **A:** 8h schedule with 1-2 hours extra?  
- **Q:** There were some translators that work only one day and others do every single day, we want to know if the hours are fixed every single day or also if it changes with the contract.  
  - **A:** It can change, some are part-time some are full time. **The schedule actually represents when they accept tasks, it doesn't mean they're working 10 hours straight every day.**  
- **Q:** Is there a way to take into accunt hollidays or something?  
  - **A:** No, this specific data is statistical, (we don't actually have it)  
- **Q:** We also wanted to know how you managed new translators, what information we have about new translators?  
  - **A:** Nothing, the most common one is after easter they start "Practicas", we interview them and just "force" some of the tasks on them so to speak.  
    - I infer that: we should always allow a manual input of a specific translator, imagine someone just started working there, the system might never recomend them.  
- **Q:** The Forecast you made it by hand or do you have a claculation?  
  - **A:** It was a way to reduce the data because we have 7 more columns, 8 more columns, for the words, and hours, it was a way to simplify and reduce the size of the data  
- **Q:** There are some examples where the validation takes a lot of days. (Between the delivery of the task and the closure of the tasks)  
  - **A:** These should be outliers  
    Usually closed means we are invoicing the tasks, and the translator can process it to get their invoice, sometimes can happen that for some reason like a client requestion some extra work.  
- **Q:** We wanted to know if its possible to try the project with the PM to see if the quality checks out? (Basically if a PM can try our system to see if they like it)  
  - **A:** With the current data it would be difficult since the data is anonymized.  
    If this evolves and at the end there is an MVP we could try something.  
- **Q:** Do you have photos for the translators? For the website  
  - **A:** We have some, but I prefer if we don't use the real fotos for that.  
- **Q:** What do you think of the project  
  - **A:** This goes for all the groups, at the end your objective is easing the pain of the PM  
    Some clients only want something quick don't care if it's a human, some others ask specifically for the human etc.
