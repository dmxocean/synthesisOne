# Questions for the professor

1. Are we supposed to just solve the problem or use as many tools as possible to "demonstrate our knowledge". More importantly, what will be the grading criteria.

## Answers, from professors

1. Answer:
You have to give a solution to the problem, a good technical solution for the problem, "the best one you cna think of". 
Maybe we have to try several options, but not just because, we need to havea reason.
We don't want you to do a system that given an input just computes and resturns an output.
We want a valid final solution to the client. Try to get a more realistic output, like multiple options, or let the final user see the reasons for the decisions in a visual way.
Non-technical aspects are more important in some sense.
The technical part is not the main thing.

## Recomendations?
Data analysis do discover underlying information about the decisions.
For example: a specific translator may be prioritized for a certain company.

# Questions/Requests for the Company

1. Can we have access to word count per task?
2. Words per hour for every translator
  2.1. Could be deduced if we get the word count.
3. If the translator speciality doesn't match the request but the other criteria does, what takes precedent?
4. Is final quality given by the client or how is it done, if not can the clients give feedback in some why, if so what is it.


5. In Task type: "Translation" it's stated that if the "ProofReading" is done by a superior the quality can be slightly lower.
  5.1. Can you define "superior" and "slighly lower"
  5.2 Do ALL "Translation" type tasks have "ProofReading" or "SpotCheck" tasks asigned after them?
6. Are "SpotCheck" and "ProofReading" tasks ONLY asigned in tandem with "Translation" or "PostEditing" tasks? Or can they be asigned by themselves.
